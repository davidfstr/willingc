Hi! I'm Carol (she/her).

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on @python, @nteract, @jupyterhub, @jupyter, @pyladies, @black
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about using notebooks for communicating and collaborating with others.
- I speak about Python, Jupyter notebooks, scaling reproducible research, learning, 
  open source governance, and more...
  Check out my [speakerdeck](https://speakerdeck.com/willingc) for more info.

When I'm not coding or mentoring/teaching, I enjoy exploring the tide pools and finding
:octopus: :shell: creatures.
